# Kamek
a nice code injection engine for Wii games - (c) Treeki 2010-2021

### Introduction

Kamek is an engine for injecting custom code into Wii games - it's designed for
*New Super Mario Bros. Wii*, but it should work with many other games as well.

(This is a fully rebuilt version of the toolchain I developed from 2010 to 2013
 for the [*Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii* project][newer]. It cannot build Newer
 in its current form, but this may be possible later.)

### TODO

- Port some of the Newer hacks to this

- More testing

### Requirements

To build and run the Kamek linker:

- .NET Framework 6.0 (installable on both Windows and non-Windows OSes)

To compile code:

- NXP ['CodeWarrior Special Edition'][cw] for MPC55xx/MPC56xx v2.10
  - If this direct link doesn't work, the original page is
    ['available on the Internet Archive'][cwIA].
  - After installing it, you need `license.dat` from the installation root,
    and the DLL and EXE files inside `PowerPC_EABI_Tools/Command_Line_Tools`.
  - Useful documentation is in `Help/Power_Arch_Build_Tools_Reference.chm`
    (or `Help/PDF/Power Architecture Build Tools Reference.pdf`)

Support for other compilers such as GCC and Clang is not planned.
(C++ code generated by these compilers uses a different ABI to
 CodeWarrior, so features like classes and virtual inheritance only work
 properly when CW is used.)
